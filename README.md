# Props and State

In this exercise, you will be working props and sending data from a parent component to a child component. The child component is where it will be displayed.
The parent component has been created already but the child component will need to be created.

## Parent Component

`DataContainer`<br>
This component is responsible for holding the child components. It will receive the data from the `DataProvider.tsx` file.
Use this component to setup the props for the child components.
Each child component should have its own component for displaying. This is done to enforce the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

## Requirements
- Pull the repository into your local system and make a new branch
    - Use your name when creating the branch
- Create a child component responsible for rendering the data on the webpage
- Use props to pass data from parent to child
- Push your branch up to the repository (**Not the main branch**)
- Make a pull request to the main branch when you are complete

This exercise should take about 30 minutes. Try to do as much as you can on your own instead of checking online, if you are still stuck then feel free to look online but make sure you understand what the solution is doing.
